# CPU-less parralel execution of lambda calculus in digital logic
his repository contains a demonstrational implementation of CPU-less parralel execution of lambda calulcus in digital logic consisting of 3 files.

1. logisim-evolution.jar 
2. LambdaCalculus.circ
3. ExampleExecution.txt

This README document will show the steps required to simulate and example execution and read it's output.
# Logisim
First open logisim-evolution.jar and in the top left of the application select File --> Open
