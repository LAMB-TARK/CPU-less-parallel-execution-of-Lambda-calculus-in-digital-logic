# CPU-less parralel execution of lambda calculus in digital logic
his repository contains a demonstrational implementation of CPU-less parralel execution of lambda calulcus in digital logic consisting of 3 files.

1. logisim-evolution.jar 
2. LambdaCalculus.circ
3. ExampleExecution.txt

This README document will show the steps required to simulate and example execution and read it's output.
# Logisim Evolution
First open logisim-evolution.jar. In the top left of the application select File --> Open and find and select the LambdaCalculus.circ file downloaded from this github

# LambdaCalculus.circ
Once you have opened LambdaCalculus.circ select the left most RAM component highlighted in red. Then in the component properties menu select contents (click to edit) to open the contents of the Hex Editor.
